        "I found some important informations like the maximum, minimum, and average salaries within each department. For example, Account Clerks had a maximum salary of around 61k but some earned as little as 614. On average Account Clerks earned around 44k annually. \n",
        "It also calculated the average year for each department, showing employees had data  around 2014 or 2011 .\n",
        "This grouped analysis provided a breakdown of salaries by department, identifying the largest and smallest in terms of employee count and total pay. It revealed the ranges of individual salaries within each role. This helped compare salaries and staffing levels across different jobs titles within the organization.\n",
        "The distribution of salarie gave a good sense of where most people fell pay-wise.\n",
        "There was a positive correlation shown between base pay and overtime pay on the scatter plot. So those earning more money regularly tended to also get more opportunities for overtime. The correlation wasn't super strong but it was definitely there.\n",
        "In the end, this analysis shed some light on typical salaries, dominant jobs, differences between employers, how pay was spread out, and the link between base and extra pay."
